### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

To an extent they did but I felt there was a disconnect since we had a bit of starter code for the lab but had to start from scratch on the assignment.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have implemented stretch features and added a few more accessibility features and extra styling too.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I saw that someone thought of creating a bact to top button which I know isn't too difficult to implement and would definitely be useful after clicking the load more button a few times.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Special thanks to Gerardo, Ethan, Gustavo, Brian and Joselyne.
